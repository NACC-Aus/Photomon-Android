            <p><b>See your environment change through the eye of a camera.</b></p>
            <p>One of the simplest and unambiguous ways to detect environmental change is by taking regular photos of exactly the same place over time. Photo-monitoring, as it is known, can be used to document change in absolutely anything you wish to photograph, from seasonal growth of algae in a rock pool to the effects of grazing on vegetation over a broad, sweeping landscape. And the great thing is, anyone can do it!</p>
            
            <p><b>Photo-monitoring provides an accurate record of environmental change if : </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every photo from a monitoring point has the same the field-of-view;</li>
                <li>Photos are taken regularly and at a frequency suitable for capturing the information you want to record;</li>
                <li>The resulting photos are easily stored and secure, yet readily accessible to those who can benefit most from the information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            The photo-monitoring app you have installed was developed by the Northern Agricultural Catchments Council (<a title="NACC" href="http://www.nacc.com.au" target="_blank">NACC</a>) to assist community volunteers to monitor beach profile change in Geraldton, Western Australia. It incorporates features aimed at simplifying the photo-monitoring process and increasing its accuracy. We hope you find it fun and useful for your own photo-monitoring needs.
